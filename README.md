# MonoSingleton base class

This base class uses generic type to transform any of your classes derived **directly from** MonoBehavior into singletons with ease. You can check out `DummySingleton.cs` file to find a usage example. And you can test this dummy singleton object by dragging `DummySingletonTest.cs` onto one of your game objects and call the `TestYell()` function in it.

That's it. Have fun!
